Unlike npm and Yarn, which create separate copies of each package for every project, pnpm uses a global store to save packages. When a package is needed for a project, pnpm creates hard links from the global store to the project's node_modules folder. This approach significantly reduces disk space usage and speeds up installation times, especially in large projects with many dependencies.

<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/yarn.png" alt="Yarn" width="300"/></a>

- ### Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that aims to improve upon npm. It focuses on speed, reliability, and security when installing and managing project dependencies.
